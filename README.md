Project title:Customer Segmentation
for Targeted Marketing 
using RNN
Problem Statement:Customer segmentation is a critical strategy for businesses aiming to personalize their marketing efforts and improve customer satisfaction
Project overview:The project aims to develop a machine learning solution for customer segmentation using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Customer segmentation plays a pivotal role in enhancing marketing strategies and fostering customer engagement by categorizing customers into meaningful groups based on their behaviors, preferences, and characteristics.
Our solution offers businesses a powerful tool for customer segmentation using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), enabling them to gain deep insights into their customer base and tailor their marketing strategies effectively. 
1. Data Preprocessing:Import and preprocess the sequential customer data, which may include transaction histories, website interactions, and other relevant behavioral data.
2. Data Splitting:Split the preprocessed data into training, validation, and test sets. It's crucial to ensure that the temporal order of the sequences is preserved during splitting to prevent data leakage.
3. Model Architecture:Design the RNN architecture tailored to the task of customer segmentation. Common choices include SimpleRNN, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), or GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit).
Overall, the results highlight the potential of RNN-based customer segmentation to provide businesses with actionable insights that can inform targeted marketing strategies, enhance customer engagement, and drive business growth.
